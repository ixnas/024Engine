# 024Engine
2D Game Engine using SDL2

## What is it?
It's a simple game engine for making 2D games. At this point it's very limited and focused towards platform gaming. Although this is what I would use it for, I want to abstract a lot more stuff so that it can be used for any type of 2D game. If you run it now, you can just walk and jump around a little bit, not much more.

## The goal
I want to make it so that the engine can be compiled once, and all the configuration of the game itself can be loaded using XML files. I'll probably never get there, because for me this is more of a learning project than anything.

## Requirements
 - CMake or GNU make
 - C++ compiler with C++14 support
 - SDL2
 - SDL2_image
 - SDL2_ttf
 - SDL2_mixer (not being used at this moment, but is included in the build files)
